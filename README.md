# PTS Visualiser

Put your test sets into the data folder and run `python clean_test_set.py data`.
For each test set the following files will be generated:
```
- latencies.csv
- throughputs.csv
- lost_samples.csv
- sample_rates.csv
- total_samples.csv
```
You can find the files in the directory of each test set.
